# SnowFlake

[Chinese](README_ZH.md) | English

## 1. Introduction

SnowFlake is a useful software package based on the open source SnowFlake algorithm created by RT-Thread.

Snowflake algorithm is an algorithm invented by Twitter. The main purpose is to solve the problem of how to generate ID in distributed environment.

Mandatory requirements for the distributed ID generation rule:

- Globally unique;

- It is essential that no duplicate ID numbers appear, since they are unique.
